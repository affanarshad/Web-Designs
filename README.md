# Web-Designs
In this Zip file I have created muliple forms and website 

Unzip the Forms-portfolio folder
My projects will be shown to you
In these projects I have made beautiful forms using the PSD
I have also created a calculator in this form which I have made with the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript/jquery
I also have a webpage which I had made responsive from mobile view to desktop view using bootstrap 4
In my code you will see that I have used CSS much less I could use.
